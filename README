Goal Statement
Opportunity Enterprises is a non-profit organization that builds tracheotomy kits as a skill-building opportunity to people with developmental disabilities. 
Our device will enable persons with disabilities to safely and easily cut rubber bands for use in tracheotomy kits.

This repository includes the program that will run on the MSP430FR4133 microcontroller used in our system.
The code will interface with several components of the machine including:
Tube Detection Sensor
